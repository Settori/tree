# First task

This program is adding name property into each leaf of given treestructure from ​**tree.json​** file with name from ​**list.json​** file.

## Usage

To run this program just type this into your terminal.

```bash
php index.php
```
This will create **names.json** file which contains correlated structures.

## Contributing
This program contains recursive function for walking through all childrens.

Not every **id** from **tree.json** is correlated to a **category_id** from **list.json**, so in this case **name property** is **null**.
